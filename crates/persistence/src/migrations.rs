//! Versioned one-time migrations, keyed by `PRAGMA user_version`.
//!
//! Only operations that are too expensive to repeat on every startup belong here - a full
//! table scan to seed derived data, or a table rebuild. Anything idempotent and cheap
//! (adding a column, creating or dropping an index) goes into the relevant `ensure_*_tables`
//! path instead, so it reaches existing databases without an upgrade cycle.
//!
//! WARNING: Published versions are append-only - never edit, reorder or remove an entry.
